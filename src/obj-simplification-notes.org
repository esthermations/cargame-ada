The main problems with the current implementation are:

* Keeping track of indices is a total nightmare
  It's really complicated and I don't know that it has to be.

  We have this:

  Unique elements <- indices <- materials

  Then when we break that out into GL attributes, we need to rejig the
  unique elements, which requires updating both the indices and the
  materials.

  I think the first step to solving this problem is just parsing the
  obj data *without transforming it*.
